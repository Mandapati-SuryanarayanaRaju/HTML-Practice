    <p><b>HTML</b> stands for <strong>HyperText Markup Language.</strong> It is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. It tells the web browser how to display 	text, links, images, and other forms of multimedia on a webpage. HTML sets up the basic structure of a website, and then CSS and JavaScript add style and interactivity to make it 	look and function better.
    <br><br><i>
	How Does HTML Work? - HTML documents are plain-text files saved with an .html extension.</i> <em>Browsers read these documents, interpret the markup (tags and attributes), and render 	the formatted content on your screen.</em>
